<b><h3>Introduction</h3></b>
We are using innovative technologies to improve the efficiency and transparency of supply chain management, which can benefit businesses by helping them better serve their customers and stakeholders.


<b><h3>Problem</h3></b> 
**Supply chain management** can be **complex and challenging**, with multiple stakeholders involved in the process of producing and delivering goods to customers.
Inefficient supply chain management can lead to
**delays, higher costs, and lower customer satisfaction**.
In addition, **lack of transparency** in the supply chain can make it difficult to trace the origin.
About **44%** of the Startups failed due to inefficient Supply Chain during the COVID period.



<b><h3>Solution</h3></b>
We are building a software which is based on  Blockchain  and decentralizes the whole   supply chain system distributing the information to all parties in supply chain   establishing :
Efficient 
Transparent 
Secure 
TruthFull Supply Chain in Todays Time

We are storing product information on the blockchain, ensuring immutability. Additionally, cryptographic QR codes are installed at all warehousing stations within the supply chain. These codes need to be scanned to automatically update the product's information on the blockchain. This process includes automatic location fetching and storing, along with date and timestamps.
